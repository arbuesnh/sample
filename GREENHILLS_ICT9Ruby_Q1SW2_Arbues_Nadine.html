            <td>Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra y Magsalin (Ibarra)</td>
            <td>Ibarra is a young, well-to-do mestizo who has recently returned
                to the Philippines from seven years of study in Europe.
                He is smart, well-respected, and very idealistic.
                As a result of his very liberal education and connections,
                the priests of San Diego all view him with profound suspicion.
                His father, the similarly idealistic Don Rafael, was imprisoned
                and eventually killed after being called a subversive and a
                heretic by the corrupt clergy. Ibarra intends to establish a
                school in San Diego in order to carry out his father's wishes
                and ideas, but due to a plot orchestrated by the cunning Father
                Salv, he is caught up in church disputes and is compelled to 
                leave the city. Ibarra normally prefers to work within existing 
                structures to improve the Philippines rather than overturn them, 
                in contrast to his more radical buddy Elas, but as the narrative 
                goes on, he starts to adopt Elas's viewpoints.

            <td>María Clara</td>
            <td>She is a woman of great social status and is believed to be Father
                Dámaso's goddaughter as well as the daughter of Capitan Tiago.
                She is truly Father Dámaso's biological child, the result of
                their scandalous connection with Capitan Tiago's wife.
                Ibarra and Maria Clara were childhood friends, but Father Dámaso
                forbade their engagement. Ibarra, who has been excommunicated
                from the church, attempts to comply with her guardians' plan
                to marry Linares, a wealthy young man of Spanish origin, in
                order to protect her weak-willed father, Capitan Tiago. She
                is forced to turn up the letters Ibarra has written her as proof
                of his guilt when he is placed on trial for sedition. After
                learning of Ibarra's alleged death, she ultimately decides against
                being married to Linares and enters a convent.

            <td>Father Damaso</td>
            <td>Father Dámaso is an elderly, ruthlessly corrupt, and Spanish priest
                who has spent almost two decades residing among the local Filipinos. 
                He has spent all that time among them, but the years have done nothing
                to make him likeable or to give him any sympathy for his "flock."
                He is deeply racist, as well as petty and vindictive, and he thinks
                nothing of using his considerable influence to ruin the lives of those
                who have wronged him, no matter how small the offense. He orchestrated
                Don Rafael Ibarra's demise before sarcastically mocking the younger Ibarra.

            <td>Elías is a strange guy who, despite his fervent religious beliefs, is on
                the run from the law and hates both the Catholic Church and the Spanish
                colonial administration. He meets the more composed Ibarra after the latter
                valiantly saves him from a crocodile. Throughout the second half of the book,
                Elas collaborates closely with Ibarra as he uncovers a plan against his life.
                Elias takes a more revolutionary attitude throughout their several lengthy
                discussions about the ethics of politics and government.

            <td>A more shrewd, younger Spanish priest takes over Father Damaso's position 
                as San Diego's friar curate. He is in many ways more dangerous than his 
                predecessor because he is a more skillful tactician who exploits his religious 
                function for both personal vengeance and political power. He constantly quarrels 
                for control with the town's ensign. He plays the most important part in the book 
                through his scheme to discredit Ibarra, who is in love with Mara Clara and 
                betrothed to her.

            <td>The nameless head of the Civil Guard of the township of San Diego. A man of
                Spanish descent, he is in a constant bitter feud with Father Salví to gain
                power in the town. He imposes curfews that make it all but impossible for the
                citizens of San Diego to attend mass at the proper schedule. He drinks
                excessively and is married to Doña Consolación, who he frequently fights with.
